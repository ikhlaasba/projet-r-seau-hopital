# projet-reseau-hopital
The architecture I proposed in this mini-project consists of a hospital network made in cisco packet tracer . The main idea is to use bracelets for patients requiring continuous monitoring. These bracelets are designed to detect abnormal variations in any of their vital parameters (heart rate, oxygen saturation, etc.).
